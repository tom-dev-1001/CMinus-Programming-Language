C- Language Project — Compiler & Language Design Experiment

C- is an experimental programming language and compiler project built to explore how modern programming languages are designed and implemented from scratch.
The goal of this project is not to create a production-ready language, but to:

-Learn the full compiler pipeline in practice
-Build a real language implementation
-Teach others through a YouTube tutorial series
-Showcase compiler engineering and systems programming skills

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of language creation, from source code parsing to executable generation.

Key Features
Language Design

- C-like syntax with modernized constructs
- fn keyword for function definitions
- Explicit, readable syntax
- Designed for simplicity and clarity

Example:
```C
fn int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
fn void main() {
    int result = add(10, 10);
    println("Result: ", result);
}
```
